# PowerShell-ProfileScripts
Samples of my Profile scripting.

Includes files which assist with encrypting passwords that can then be used to connect to different services such as Office 365, Skype for Business and Dynamics CRM systems (with specific modules installed of course).

Has a bunch of useful added functions I created in the Profile Module. 

Different profile templates for different editors. 

Global prompt changes are included in the profile templates.
